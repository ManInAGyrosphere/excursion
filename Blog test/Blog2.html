<h2>Type Combination</h2> 
<p>Grass/Steel type combination allows Ferrothorn to not only resist many types,
  grass types are immune to annoying grass type guarantee status contition moves often from bug and grass types like Spore.
  Steel type also has an immunity to poison which prevents the pokemon from being poisoned. It only has two weaknesses,
  one of them being being a 4x weakness to fire. </p>

  <h2>Iron Barbs Ability</h2>
  <p>Ferrothorn has the Iron Barbs ability which attackers take damage when they make physical contact with it.</p>

  <h2>Trick Room</h2>
  <p>Ferrothorn has a very poor speed stat of 20.
    Good news is that makes it very usefull in Trick Room.
    It also can learn curse, which for it, sacrifices speed for attack and defense. 
    This also makes the Pokemon move faster in Trick Room.
    Although it cannot learn Trick Room, it's better to use another Pokemon that can learn it anyways.</p>
